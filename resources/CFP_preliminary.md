# CALL FOR PAPERS
## First International Workshop on Cyberbiosecurity (CyberBio 2026)
### Co-located with IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2026
#### May 21, 2026 | San Francisco, CA, USA

## Overview
The convergence of digital technologies and biological systems is driving the bioeconomy while introducing novel security risks that extend beyond traditional cybersecurity. The First International Workshop on Cyberbiosecurity (CyberBio 2026) brings together researchers, practitioners, and industry leaders to address the emerging security challenges at the intersection of cybersecurity and biological systems. As the bioeconomy increasingly relies on digital infrastructure, from DNA synthesis and laboratory automation to bioinformatics and supply chain management, new attack surfaces emerge that require specialized security frameworks transcending traditional cybersecurity boundaries. There is an growing need to adapt cybersecurity practices for biological systems. 
This workshop focuses on protecting biological research, biomanufacturing, and bioeconomic infrastructure from digital threats and on promoting secure-by-design approaches for emerging biotechnologies. It is a premier forum fostering collaboration between the cybersecurity community and biotechnology stakeholders.

## Information for Authors

### Contribution Categories
*	Full Papers (6-10 pages): Original research contributions with comprehensive evaluation
*	Short Papers (up to 5 pages): Work-in-progress, preliminary results, or focused contributions
*	Industry Papers (up to 5 pages): Practical experiences, deployed solutions, or industrial case studies
*	Position Papers (up to 5 pages): Vision statements, outstanding challenges, or perspectives on future directions
*	Presentation abstracts (up to 2 pages): Prominent cyberbiosecurity papers recently accepted elsewhere  

### Submissions
•	Submissions should be uploaded to the workshop submission system at: <EasyChair URL to be provided>
•	At least one author of accepted papers must register for and attend the workshop to present the paper
•	Submissions of papers should not substantially overlap with papers published or under review at other venues. Accepted papers will appear in the IEEE CS Press published proceedings.
•	Presentation abstracts may report findings that were published or are about to be published elsewhere. Presentation abstracts will appear on the workshop website and will not be included in proceedings.  

### Review Process
*	All submissions will undergo rigorous peer review by program committee members
*	Review criteria include technical quality, originality, relevance to cyberbiosecurity, clarity, and dual use. During submission authors must flag potential dual use such as possibly actionable biological protocols, sequence-level exploit details, or other sensitive artifacts. Qualified PC members will review sensitive artifact and provide instructions to reduce risk if needed. 
*	Authors will receive detailed feedback regardless of acceptance decision
